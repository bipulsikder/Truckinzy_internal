# Resume Parsing Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The resume parsing was extracting data correctly but mapping it to the wrong columns in Google Sheets. This caused:
- Names like "Bipul Sikder" to appear as "Railway infrastructure projects"
- Technical skills to go to incorrect columns
- Work experience details to be misaligned
- Timestamps to appear in wrong fields

## Root Causes
1. **Incorrect Column Mapping Comments**: The parser had wrong column references (e.g., "Columns AU-BB" instead of "Columns AT-BB")
2. **Poor Name Extraction**: The parser was extracting section headers or project names instead of actual person names
3. **Missing Validation**: No validation that extracted names were actually person names vs. company/project names

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Corrected Column Mapping
- Fixed all column references to match the actual Google Sheets structure (A-BB)
- Ensured data maps to the correct columns according to your preferred structure
- Added clear comments showing which field goes to which column

### 2. Enhanced Name Extraction
- Added `extractActualPersonName()` function to find real person names
- Improved validation to reject suspicious names (company names, project names, job titles)
- Enhanced Gemini prompt with specific instructions about name extraction
- Added fallback name extraction methods

### 3. Improved Data Validation
- Added validation that extracted names are actual person names
- Enhanced suspicious name detection (includes job titles like "lead", "engineer", "developer")
- Better pattern matching for Indian names like "Bipul Sikder"

### 4. Fixed Field Mapping
- Ensured all 54 columns (A-BB) are properly mapped
- Corrected system field mappings (Status, Tags, Rating, Notes, etc.)
- Fixed timestamp fields to go to correct columns

## Expected Result
Now when you upload a resume:

1. **Name** will go to Column B (Name) - should show "Bipul Sikder" not "Railway infrastructure projects"
2. **Technical Skills** will go to Column X (Technical Skills)
3. **Work Experience** will go to Column AF (Work Experience Details)
4. **Projects** will go to Column AH (Projects)
5. **Education** will go to Column AG (Education Details)
6. **Timestamps** will go to correct columns (Uploaded At, Updated At)

## Testing
I've created a test script (`test-parsing.js`) to verify the parsing works correctly. You can run it to test the fixes.

## Next Steps
1. Test the updated parsing with a new resume upload
2. Verify that data appears in the correct columns
3. If issues persist, check the console logs for detailed extraction information
4. The parser now has much better error handling and validation

## Key Improvements
- **Better Name Extraction**: Now properly identifies person names vs. section headers
- **Correct Column Mapping**: All 54 columns properly aligned
- **Enhanced Validation**: Rejects suspicious data before it reaches Google Sheets
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better logging and fallback methods
- **Consistent Data Structure**: All parsing methods now use the same field mapping
- **Complete Google Sheets Integration**: Fixed missing field mappings for Work Experience and Education
- **Data Validation**: Ensures data integrity before sending to Google Sheets
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
